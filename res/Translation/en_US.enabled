Name this file to whatever language you want to use assuming they have been translated
en_US = english US assuming standard naming but it can be anything
AKA jap for japanese needs jap folder and jap.enabled and jap.lang
if you translate make jap.lang and have pee=おしっこ at least, and only rename this file to jap.enabled DO NOT CREATE MULTIPLE .enabled FILES!!!
also you must translate at least 1 string of each type in sex.lang IE sex.dom.rough.peeDrink=
