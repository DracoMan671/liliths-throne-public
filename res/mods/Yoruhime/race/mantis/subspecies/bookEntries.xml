	<p>
		As their name suggest, mantid-morphs are insectoids, and their limbs are as sharp as their feral counterparts, although they've skilled enough to make delicate movements without damaging what they touch.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most other races, mantids-morphs are affected by arcane storms and experience heightened libidos. Fortunately, they do not share the same mating habits as feral mantids, so their partners's life aren't menaced, even if their lust can be difficult to satiate.
	</p>
	<p>
		A mantis-morph's offspring will be a mixture of mantid-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
