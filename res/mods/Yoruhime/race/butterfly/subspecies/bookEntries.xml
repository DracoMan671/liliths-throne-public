	<p>
		Butterfly-morphs are peaceful insectoids, spending their days fluttering carelessly from flower to flower, seeking the purest nectar to feed upon. Closely related to them, moth-morphs are almost identical to them, except that their wings emit a poisonous mist, which they use to protect themselves.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like most other races, butterfly-morphs are affected by arcane storms and experience heightened libidos. They use their natural charms and quick reflexes to secure a mate when aroused by the storm.
	</p>
	<p>
		A butterfly-morph's offspring will be a mixture of butterfly-morphs and offspring of their partner's race.
