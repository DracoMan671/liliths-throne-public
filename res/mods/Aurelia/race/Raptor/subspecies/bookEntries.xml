		The raptor-morphs' lack of any significant power or arcane abilities is made up for by an inhuman speed and cunning matched only by demons. While their ancestors had a pack mentality, these new descendants of the older reptiles are neither afraid nor are they merciful in a fight, even when outnumbered. Their leathery hides defend them from many attacks as is, and thanks to their nomadic nature, there is no one place to find these creatures, if one is even lucky enough to locate one before they're too close...

		Raptor-morphs generally have a solitude based mentality, wanting to have their peace and quiet for the sake of hunting, whether their prey be for food or for sexual relief. The males are quite capable of determining one's sex, but care very little when the mood strikes, although females tend to prefer anything with a cock big enough to strike their cervix. It should go without saying that their claws are the primary weapon of choice, but one should not forget about the raw strength these beasts possess. If one of them wants to mate, there is very little that shall get in their way, be it clothing, armor, or another person.

		Oddly, during arcane storms, raptor-morphs give off eerie glows across their form, like a lightning bolt inside of them lighting their veins up like a neon sign. During this, it seems their lusts are taken to a more tame fashion somehow... like the storm soothes their wild minds.
