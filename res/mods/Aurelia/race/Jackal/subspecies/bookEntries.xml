		Jackals are nothing new to the world, but in terms of residence in Dominion, they only recently began to pop up. These black-furred canines, at least the males, bear resemblance to the ancient Egyptian god, Anubis, and have brought with them treats from the desert. Built for the hot weather, these dogs are not used to the colder weather of Dominion, and frequently have to find ways to heat up.

	<p>
		The Jackals tend to roam the cities as prostitutes, and often, they form harems with their partners, liking the idea of open relationships. With each day they roam, they hide from the enforcers in nearly plain sight, lurking in the darkened corners. They would rather seduce an opponent than attack, but will defend themselves if need be.

		Not much is known of how the Jackals react to Dominion's more magical weather as they prefer to stay out of storms.
