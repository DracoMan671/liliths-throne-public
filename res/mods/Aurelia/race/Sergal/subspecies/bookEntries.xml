		The sergals are an alien race to Dominion, with only their genetic history being known as former humanoids that have become animal-like in appearance. Between their sharp claws and wedged heads, they tend to look the part of a predator, but when it comes down to details, the reality is that they lack any real ability to inflict major lasting damage with their bites due to having only twelve teeth, set in neat rows of three on the upper and lower jaw at the side. Their kicks are still powerful though, as are their tails.

		Sergals tend to have a very militaristic personality, at least the breed that has made it down to the surface around Dominion. They hunt in groups when needed, but are strong enough to tackle any foe alone. Not needing magic much, they do have the ability to use it to some extent. It should be noted that due to magic around Dominion, this breed of Sergals have grown more distinct members, meant for the sole purpose of reproduction, ensuring they remain a constant around the city.

		Sergals have an odd reaction to arcane storms, tending to mistake them for something far worse thanks to their constant planet hopping. This fear they have prevents them from understanding just why these storms pump their sex drives into overdrive, but a few outlying members of the species enjoy the weather.
