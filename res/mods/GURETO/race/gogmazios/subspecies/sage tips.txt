Use the "Edit paths by nodes" tool to help fill in the white spaces that the fill tool didn't reach. it's the second tool down and you can adjust shapes with it.

Something to watch out for when doing svgs too is filesize.  Using the fill tool instead of color filling shapes will bloat the size because it has to redraw the shape and generally adds a lot of extra points while doing so.
