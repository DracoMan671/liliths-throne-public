# Follow this example
# Need 1 name minimum but 3 is best (Masculine, Androgenous, Feminine) name the game uses a triplet naming schematic
# Races the game listens to (not my code but Innoxia's)
# human/equine/reindeer/prostitute/lilin
# For some reason she set all other to use human names except demons, they use randomly generated names from a small template. Not a list I chose modify;
# Any lines starting with # are ignored feel free to comment ones out you can't finish
# share your name lists if you feel like it so we can propagate a good sized name list
